# 🐹 Capybara

Capybara is my personal long-term AI journey.

This project begins with a simple mood-based command line assistant
and will gradually evolve into a smarter system with memory,
learning ability, and real interaction.

## Version 1 – Mood Advice CLI
Capybara v1 is a simple Python program that:

- asks the user about their mood
- gives short supportive advice
- stores mood history during runtime

This is the **first public step** of the Capybara evolution.

## Future Vision
Planned future versions include:

- persistent memory (save moods to file/database)
- web interface
- mobile interaction
- intelligent learning system
- real AI assistant architecture

## Purpose
This repository represents:

- my learning journey in programming
- consistency in building real projects
- the foundation of a long-term AI system
